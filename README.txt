TriplClust: Curve Detection in 3D Point Clouds
==============================================

This code implements the algorithm described in
(cited as "IPOL paper" below):

C. Dalitz, J. Wilberg, L. Aymans: "TriplClust: An Algorithm
for Curve Detection in 3D Point Clouds." IPOL, 20xx

triplclust reads a 3D or 2D point cloud from a CSV file and assigns
each point cluster labels representing curves or noise.


Compilation
-----------

Building the code requires cmake and a standard C++98 (or later) compiler.
We have tested the code with gcc 5.4.0, LLVM 9.0.0, and MSVC 15.7.5.

Starting from the root directory (i.e., the directory, in which this
Readme file is located), the code is compiled with ($ is the shell prompt):

    $ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make

This will create the executable "triplclust" that accepts point clouds
of arbitrary size. For the IPOL webdemo, the executable "triplclust-demo"
can be built with

    $ make demo

The only difference between "triplclust-demo" and "triplclust" is that
"triplclust-demo" only accepts a maximum number of 1000 points. This is
to avoid a denial-of-service attack on the website hosting the demo.


Usage
-----

Calling triplclust without any or with an unknown option (e.g. "-?")
will print a usage message. The meaning of the parameters controlling
the algorithm is explained in the IPOL paper.

The input file can contain 3D or 2D point coordinates, one point per line
with the coordinates separated by a delimiter character. The default delimiter
is the space character, but a different character can be specified with the
command line option "-delim <char>". Lines starting with a hash (#) are
ignored. 

Unless the option "-oprefix <prefix>" is given, the output is printed to
stdout. The default output format is a comma separated file with two header
lines (starting with #) and one point per line followed by the cluster label.
For points belonging to more than one cluster, all labels are given separated
by semicolons.

With the option "-gnuplot", the output is instead a gnuplot command that
can directly be used for visualizing the result. When the options "-gnuplot"
and "-oprefix <prefix>" are given, the result is not printed to stdout,
but into two files: CSV format to "<prefix>.csv", gnuplot command to
"<prefix>.gnuplot".

When the option "-v" is given, automatically computed default values are
additionally printed to stdout with the prefix "[Info]".

Example calls with the provided test file 'test.dat':

  1) direct visualization with gnuplot:
     $ triplclust test.dat -gnuplot | gnuplot -persist

  2) write result to files result.csv and result.gnuplot and print
     automatically computed parameters:
     $ triplclust test.dat -v -oprefix result -gnuplot

When the option "-vv" is given, data files documenting intermediate steps
of the algorithm are written: "debug_smoothed.csv" and "debug_smoothed.gnuplot"
contain the points after smoothing (Figure 2 in the IPOL paper), and
"debug_cdist.csv" contains the sequence of cluster distances of all merge
steps in the hierarchical clustering. This file can be important for finding
good stopping thresholds for the clustering. A plot similar to Figure 4 in
the IPOL paper can be created with the R script "cdist-plot.r".
Example ("$" is the shell prompt)::

  $ triplclust test.dat -vv
  $ Rscript cdist-plot.r
  cdist plot is written to 'debug_cdist.pdf'
